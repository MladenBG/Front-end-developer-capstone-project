      <h2>
        Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant,
        <br />
        focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist. The chefs draw inspiration from
        <br />
        Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of 12–15 items that they rotate seasonally.
        <br />
        The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place
        <br />
        for a meal any time of the day. Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, 
        <br />
        who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant.
        <br />
        To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy. 
        <br />
        Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond
        <br />
        classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.
